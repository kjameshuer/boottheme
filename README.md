# WordPress Theme Development Starter (Bootstrap)

YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE AN APACHE SERVER / MYSQL DB SET UP AND RUNNING FOR THIS TO WORK.

  - Theme with Bootstrap configured and ready to go
  - Font Awesome 4.7.0 has been added
  - Use settings.js to configure the project
  - To run project start with gulp watch
  - Full webpack solution (without gulp) coming soon, ran into problems serving files and watching for php with webpack-dev-server
